[![Dynamic Progression and Difficulty Versions](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/Minecraft_650016_all.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-player-progression-and-difficulty)

Dynamically balanced the progression and difficulty for new and experienced player on the same
server.
In most cases it's difficult to balanced new players with experience players without frustrating one
group.

## ✨ Features

- Dynamically adjust dealt damage (from the Player)
- Dynamically adjust hurt damage (to the Player)
- Dynamically adjust item damage and durability (per Weapon Class)
- Experience points / levels for different kind of areas based on existing stats
- Customization over config file
- Weapon classes with weapon progression (more damage, faster, ...) and mod support
- Use the existing user stats, which mean existing experienced players will start with a higher
  level and not with level 1.

## ℹ️ What does the mod do ?

For new players it will increase the dealt damage and decrease hurt damage to the player.
For more experience players it will slight increase the dealt damage per weapon class (over time)
and increase the hurt damage to the player for a more challenging experience with additional getting
more experience and loot.

With each kill you will earn experience points for a specific areas and weapon classes, which is
used to adjust the progression and difficulty per player dynamically.

This means new players will not get killed every few seconds and experience players will get a
harder time to kill mobs and need to find new strategies and better equipment.

Depending on your preferred weapons the durability of the items will be also automatically adjusted
so that you can play with an axe or even with a hoe.
